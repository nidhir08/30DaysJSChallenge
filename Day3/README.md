# Control Structures in JavaScript 
Control structures are fundamental in programming as they allow the flow of execution to be controlled based on conditions. In JavaScript, the primary control structures include if-else statements, nested if-else statements, switch case statements, and ternary operators. 

## 1. If-Else Statements
The if-else statement is a basic control structure that executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, an optional else block can execute an alternative block of code.

## 2. Nested If-Else Statements
Nested if-else statements involve placing one or more if-else statements inside another if or else block. This allows for more complex decision-making based on multiple conditions.

## 3. Switch Case Statements
The switch statement is used to execute one of many blocks of code based on the value of an expression. It is often used as an alternative to multiple if-else statements when comparing a single variable to several values.

## 4. Ternary Operator
The ternary operator (?:) is a shorthand for if-else statements and is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands. It is used to evaluate a condition and return one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false.
