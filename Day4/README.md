# Loops
## 1. For Loops
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
## 2. While Loops
The while loop runs as long as the condition remains true. It is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
## 3. Do...While Loops
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once because the condition is evaluated after the code block executes.
## 4. Nested Loops
Nested loops are loops inside other loops. They are useful for iterating over multi-dimensional arrays or matrices.
## 5. Loop Control Statements
JavaScript provides several control statements to alter the flow of loops:

### break: Exits the loop immediately, regardless of the condition.

### continue: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
