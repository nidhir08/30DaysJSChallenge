# 30DaysJSChallenge

ðŸš€ Welcome to My JavaScript Journey! ðŸš€

Hello everyone,

I am Nidhi, and I am thrilled to share my journey through the 30-Day JavaScript Challenge by the amazing Hitesh Choudhary, founder of "Chai aur Code." This challenge aims to transform our JavaScript skills by covering core subjects, related questions, data structures and algorithms (DSA), and hands-on project creation.

Each day, tackle a new problem or project covering various JS concepts like variables, functions, DOM manipulation, and more. Fork the repository, solve the challenges, and commit the solutions on GitHub daily.This challenge is perfect for building a strong foundation and improving problem-solving skills.
