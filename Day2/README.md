# JavaScript Operators Overview
JavaScript operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands. They are classified into various categories based on their functionality. Below is an overview of the main categories of operators in JavaScript: arithmetic, logical, comparison, assignment, and ternary operators.
## 1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations.

Addition (+): Adds two operands.\
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.\
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.\
Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second.\
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.

## 2. Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine or invert boolean values.

AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.\
OR (||): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.\
NOT (!): Inverts the boolean value of the operand.

## 3. Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values, resulting in a boolean value.

Equal (==): Checks if two values are equal (type conversion occurs).\
Strict Equal (===): Checks if two values are equal and of the same type.\
Not Equal (!=): Checks if two values are not equal (type conversion occurs).\
Strict Not Equal (!==): Checks if two values are not equal or not of the same type.\
Greater Than (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right.\
Less Than (<): Checks if the left operand is less than the right.\
Greater Than or Equal (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.\
Less Than or Equal (<=): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.

## 4. Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

Assignment (=): Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.\
Addition Assignment (+=): Adds the value of the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.\
Subtraction Assignment (-=): Subtracts the value of the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.\
Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.\
Division Assignment (/=): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.\
Modulus Assignment (%=): Assigns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand to the left operand.

## 5. Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement. It takes three operands and is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands.

Syntax: condition ? expr1 : expr2 \
If the condition is true, expr1 is returned; otherwise, expr2 is returned.
